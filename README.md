### Kia ora 👋

I'm Finn - a high school science teacher in New Zealand! I studied in Physics and Astronomy before becoming a teacher, but also love to code.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [__Science.LeSueur.NZ__: making an awesome teaching resource for the New Zealand high school science curriculum](https://science.lesueur.nz),
  - [__Adventure Log NZ__: a little website to get information about New Zealand huts/camping sites](https://adventurelog.nz)
- 💬 Ask me about developing a website for your project/business!
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript (vanilla), PHP ([Laravel](https://laravel.com) & [PyroCMS](https://pyrocms.com)), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), Python!
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email me](mailto:finn@lesueur.nz) or on [Telegram](https://t.me/finnito)

🏔 Mostly, I just love being outdoors though. You can find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4215769) doing my best to be outside!
